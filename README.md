# 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Hunt Game

An interactive, browser-based **Treasure Hunt Game** set inside a mysterious labyrinth.  
Players must choose paths, solve puzzles, avoid traps, and make the right final choice to win the ultimate treasure.

This project transforms a **pure C-language logic problem** into a **fully playable web game** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

- The player starts at the entrance of a labyrinth.
- Three paths are available:
  - **Left Path** (Swamp)
  - **Middle Path** (Maze)
  - **Right Path** (Underground Vault)
- Each path contains unique challenges and puzzles.
- If the player survives the path, they reach the **Final Treasure Room**.
- Only one chest leads to victory.

## 🧠 Logic Reference (Important)

The **core game logic** for this project was originally implemented in **C language** as part of a **HackerRank assignment**.

📌 **Reference:**
- Repository: `hackerank-assignment`
- Question Number: **39**
- Topic: **If-Else / Decision-based Logic**

This web version:
- Preserves the **exact decision flow and conditions** from the C program
- Reimplements the logic using **JavaScript**
- Enhances the experience with a cinematic UI and interactivity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure and layout
- **CSS** – Cinematic UI, animations, and theming
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic and state handling
- **GitHub Pages** – Live deployment
